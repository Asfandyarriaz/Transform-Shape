1. Game Fluidity  (Fixed)
  
  -When swapping between vehicles there's a small pause that stops the vehicle from moving
   it happens once per level when player select another vehicles 
   for e.g: Switching between character -> Car. 
   Desired output would be to a seamless transition and motion should not be disrupted
   but motion is stopped for a few moments before running again


2. Non passable vehicles should slide down from stairs 
   
   -In reference game when vehicles that are not supposed to pass staris are selected 
    they slide down 
   -In our game, movement stops and vehicle are stuck in that position


3. Cars Flipping Over (Fixed)
   
   -Vehicles sometimes flip over because of rotation script attached onto them
    and this cause buggy behavior 

    1.Sometimes occur when Boat -> Car 
    2.Crossing a hill and when car is in air

4. Boat clipping through water
   
   -Sometimes boat clip through water

6. AI Too Strong (Fixed)
   
  -Feedback was given that AI was weak
   Now feedback is given that AI is too strong.
  -Need to significantly reduce AI difficulty 

7. On Mobile character movement feels jerky 
 
 -It could either be because of low fps 
  or cinemachine not switching update states properly to detect when to choose
  either Update, FixedUpdate or LateUpdate. 

8. Car Feels lifeless (Fixed)
  
  -We could change camera angle backward after a few moment when car is selected
   to give the illusion of high speed.

9. Boat exit from water 

  -When boat is coming out of water, theres a little fall or jump that is felt
   and that transition breaks the immersion.

10. Upgrade Screen Buggy 
   
   -Upgrade Screen needs a total overhaul 

11. Character climbing speed slow (Fixed)
    
    -When character is climbing walls it feels slow
    -Although through character upgrading from upgrade screen we could easily fix 
     this issue ( Need to discuss further)

12. Remove skip button from upgrade screen (Fixed)
    
    -Skip Button is too distracting and needs to be removed

13. Vehicle unlock screen 99% issue (Fixed)
    
    -Vehicle unlocks percentage reaches 99% instead of 100% need to fix

14. Next level transition   (Fixed)
    
   -Transition from one level to another needs rework
   -Currently is works by turn virtual camera 2 off and cinemachine transitions
    to currenlty active camera 
   -Feedback was given this does not feel good 
   -Suggestion : Do Reload Scene

15. Character climbing animation issue 
    
    -When wall climbing is reached theres an animation bug where character switches between wall climbing to running
     then back to wall climbing 

16. Car stops moving at the edge of stairs 
    
    -At the very last step of stairs if we switch to car, car does not move 
     even though in user's eyes it feels like stairs have finished but 
     technically car still detects stair colliders

17. Smoke particles not resetting their rotation (Fixed)
   
    -At times when we switch to vehciles at an angle, smoke particles 
     also changes their rotation and do not reset themselves.

18. Tank collision with obstacles feels buggy (Fixed) 
    
    -When tank collides with obstacles, it feels jerky and not smooth 
     as if tank stops for a split second and waits for obstacle to turn off 
    
19. Tank rotation after obstacle collision (Fixed)
     
    -Sometimes tank tries to rotate itself after hitting an obstacle. 

20. AI clipping through ground when colliding with obstacles (Fixed)
    
    -Sometimes when AI collides with obstacle they clip through ground and fall down 

21. AI keep transition from tank to car (Fixed)(Partially)

   -Although constraints are given to stop AI from transiting from tank to car but
    it needs rework 

22. Wall climbing clipping bug (Fixed)

   -If by any means we force vehicles to clip through wall climbing by switching between vehicles
    we see unexpected behavior 

23. Tank body not resetting position (Fixed)

   -there is not constraint to reset tank bodys position 
    and sometimes through whatnot trigger tank body comes below its original position 
    and starts clipping through tyres. And keeps this behavior untill game restarts. 

24. Double Water Patch
     
    -Double the water patch, 1 patch feels small and user cant experince the water 
    -Moreover user can even skip the water if needed

    -Boat feels clunky and slow in water increase speed 

26. Vehicle Unlock Screen Image feels blurry, Check compression
    
    -UI Images feels blurry

27. Reward Meter Images Feels blurry, 

    -UI Images feels blurry

28. Duck Particles 

    -Add destruction particles to ducks

29. Duck/Baloon Character collide then fall (Fixed)

    -If a character collides with an obstacle he should be pushed back and fall down

30. if a vehicle is already selected dont select/transform in it again (Fixed)
 
    -if a vehicle is selected dont select it again  

31. Scooter speed increase few points less than car (Fixed)

    -Increase Scooter speed 

32. Scooter 20% Boat 10% scale reduction (Fixed)

    -Size too big reduce

33. Change Scooter Textures (Fixed)

34. Plane reduce speed (Fixed)

35. Marker name for both AI and Player (Fixed)

36. Scooter tyre rotation speed increase 100 - > 350 (Fixed) 

37. Add animation to character colliding and falling by hitting an obstacle

38. Add baloons and pop particle effect on them
